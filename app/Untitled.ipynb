       "'Roger Federer (German: [ˈfeːdərər]; born 8 August 1981) is a Swiss professional tennis player who is currently ranked world No. 3 by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP). Many commentators and players regard Federer as the greatest tennis player of all time. Federer turned professional in 1998 and has been ranked inside the top 10 since October 2002.\\nFederer holds several records of the Open Era: holding the world No. 1 position for 302 weeks (including 237 consecutive weeks); winning 17 Grand Slam singles titles; reaching each Grand Slam final at least five times (an all-time record); and reaching the Wimbledon final ten times. He is among the seven men (and among the four in Open Era) to capture a career Grand Slam. Federer shares an Open Era record for most titles at Wimbledon with Pete Sampras (7) and at the US Open with Jimmy Connors and Sampras (5).\\nFederer has reached 27 men\\'s singles Grand Slam finals, including 10 in a row from the 2005 Wimbledon Championships to the 2007 US Open, both statistics being records. He also appeared in 18 of 19 finals from the 2005 Wimbledon through to the 2010 Australian Open. He reached the semifinals at 23 consecutive Grand Slam tournaments, from the 2004 Wimbledon Championships through the 2010 Australian Open. At the 2015 US Open, he played in a record 64th consecutive Grand Slam tournament, reached a record 46th Grand Slam quarterfinal, a record 38th Grand Slam semifinal and a record 27th Grand Slam final. Earlier at the 2013 French Open, Federer reached a record 36th consecutive Grand Slam quarterfinal. Federer has won the most matches in Grand Slams (297) and is the first to record 65+ wins at each Grand Slam tournament.\\nFederer\\'s ATP tournament records include winning a record six ATP World Tour Finals, playing in the finals at all nine ATP Masters 1000 tournaments (a record shared with Djokovic and Nadal), and having won the most prize money of any player in history. He also won the Olympic gold medal in doubles with his compatriot Stan Wawrinka at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games and the Olympic silver medal in singles at the 2012 Summer Olympic Games. Representing Switzerland, he was a part of the 2014 winning Davis Cup team. He spent eight years (2003–2010) continuously in the top 2 in the year-end men\\'s rankings and ten (2003–2012) in the top 3. He was named the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year for a record four consecutive years (2005–2008).\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\n\\n\\n=== Childhood and early life ===\\nFederer was born at the Basel Cantonal Hospital in Basel, Switzerland. His father, Robert Federer, is Swiss, from Berneck, near the borders between Switzerland, Austria and Germany; and his mother, Lynette Federer (born Durand), from Kempton Park, Gauteng, is a South African whose ancestors were Dutch and French Huguenots. Federer has one sibling, his older sister Diana, who is the mother of a set of twins. He holds both Swiss and South African citizenship. He grew up in nearby Birsfelden, Riehen, and then Münchenstein, close to the French and German borders and speaks Swiss German, Standard German, English and French fluently, Swiss German being his native language.\\n\\nFederer was raised as a Roman Catholic and met Pope Benedict XVI while playing the 2006 Internazionali BNL d\\'Italia tournament in Rome. Like all male Swiss citizens, Federer was subject to compulsory military service in the Swiss Armed Forces. However, in 2003 he was deemed unfit because of a long-standing back problem and was subsequently not required to fulfill his military obligation. Luckily, he managed to overcome this ailment enough to win Wimbledon later that year. He grew up supporting F.C. Basel and the Swiss National Football Team. Federer also credits the range of sports he played as a child—he also played badminton and basketball—for his hand-eye coordination.\\n\\n\\n=== Family ===\\n\\nFederer is married to former Women\\'s Tennis Association player Mirka Vavrinec. He met her while both were competing for Switzerland in the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Vavrinec retired from the tour in 2002 because of a foot injury. They were married at Wenkenhof Villa in Riehen near Basel on 11 April 2009, surrounded by a small group of close friends and family. In July 2009, Mirka gave birth to identical twin girls, Myla Rose and Charlene Riva. The Federers had another set of twins in 2014, this time boys whom they named Leo and Lennart, called Lenny.\\n\\n\\n=== Philanthropy and outreach ===\\nIn 2003, he established the Roger Federer Foundation to help disadvantaged children and to promote their access to education and sports. Since May 2004, citing his close ties with South Africa including because that is where his mother was raised, he started supporting the South Africa-Swiss charity IMBEWU which helps children better connect to sports and social and health awareness and, in 2005, Federer visited South Africa to meet the children that had benefited from his support. In 2005, he auctioned his racquet from his US Open championship to aid victims of Hurricane Katrina. At the 2005 Pacific Life Open in Indian Wells, Federer arranged an exhibition involving several top players from the ATP and WTA tour called Rally for Relief. The proceeds went to the victims of the tsunami caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. In December 2006 he visited Tamil Nadu, one of the areas in India most affected by the tsunami. He was appointed a Goodwill Ambassador by UNICEF in April 2006 and has appeared in UNICEF public messages to raise public awareness of AIDS. In response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake, he arranged a collaboration with fellow top tennis players for a special charity event during the 2010 Australian Open called \\'Hit for Haiti\\', in which proceeds went to Haiti earthquake victims. He participated in a follow-up charity exhibition during the 2010 Indian Wells Masters which raised $1 million. The Nadal vs Federer \"Match for Africa\" in 2010 in Zurich and Madrid raised more than $4 million for the Roger Federer Foundation and Fundación Rafa Nadal. In January 2011 Federer took part in an exhibition, Rally for Relief, to raise money for the victims of the Queensland floods. In 2014 the Match for Africa 2 between Federer and Stan Wawrinka, again in Zurich, raised £850,000 for education projects in southern Africa.\\n\\n\\n== Tennis career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Pre–1998: Junior years ===\\n\\nFederer\\'s main accomplishments as a junior player came at Wimbledon in 1998, where he won both the boys\\' singles final over Irakli Labadze, and in doubles teamed with Olivier Rochus, defeating the team of Michaël Llodra and Andy Ram. In addition, Federer lost the US Open Junior final in 1998 to David Nalbandian. He won four ITF junior singles tournaments in his career, including the prestigious Orange Bowl, where he defeated Guillermo Coria in the final. He ended 1998 with the no. 1 junior world ranking, and he entered his first tournament as a professional during 1998 in Gstaad, where he lost to Lucas Arnold Ker in the first round.\\n\\n\\n=== 1998–2002: Early career and breakthrough in the ATP ===\\n\\nFederer entered the top 100 ranking for the first time on 20 September 1999. His first final came at the Marseille Open in 2000, where he lost to fellow Swiss Marc Rosset. Federer won the 2001 Hopman Cup representing Switzerland, along with Martina Hingis. The duo defeated the American pair of Monica Seles and Jan-Michael Gambill in the finals. Federer\\'s first singles win was at the 2001 Milan Indoor tournament, where he defeated Julien Boutter in the final. Although he won his first title already in 1999 on the Challenger tour, winning the doubles event in Segovia, Spain with Dutchman Sander Groen, the final was played on Federer\\'s 18th birthday. In 2001, Federer made his first Grand Slam quarterfinal at the French Open, and at Wimbledon that same year defeated four-time defending champion Pete Sampras to reach the quarterfinals. The most prestigious event final he reached during this period was the 2002 Miami Masters event, where he lost to Andre Agassi on hard court.\\nFederer won his first Master Series event at the 2002 Hamburg Masters on clay, over Marat Safin; the victory put him in top 10 for the first time. Federer made 10 singles finals between 1998 and 2002, of which he won four and lost six. He also made six finals in doubles. Of note are Federer and partner Max Mirnyi\\'s defeat in the final of the Indian Wells Masters in 2002, and their victory in the same year in the final of the Rotterdam 500 series event. Federer had won the latter a year earlier with partner Jonas Björkman. He finished 2001 with an ATP ranking of no. 13, and 2002 was the first year he was ranked within the top 10, finishing at no. 6.\\n\\n\\n=== 2003: Wimbledon breakthrough ===\\n\\nIn 2003, Federer won his first Grand Slam singles title at Wimbledon, beating Mark Philippoussis in the final. Federer won his first and only doubles Masters Series 1000 event in Miami with Max Mirnyi and made it to one singles Masters Series 1000 event in Rome on clay, which he lost. Federer made it to nine finals on the ATP Tour and won seven of them, including the 500 series events at Dubai and Vienna. Lastly, Federer won the year-end championships over Andre Agassi, finishing the year as world No. 2, narrowly behind Andy Roddick.\\n\\n\\n=== 2004: Imposing dominance ===\\n\\nDuring 2004, Federer won three Grand Slam singles titles for the first time in his career and became the first person to do so since Mats Wilander in 1988. His first Grand Slam hard-court title came at the Australian Open over Marat Safin, thereby becoming the world no. 1 for the first time. He then won his second Wimbledon crown over Andy Roddick. Federer defeated the 2001 US Open champion, Lleyton Hewitt, at the US Open for his first title there.\\nFederer won three ATP Masters Series 1000 events, one was on clay in Hamburg, and the other two were on hard surfaces at Indian Wells and in Canada. Federer took the ATP 500 series event at Dubai and wrapped up the year by winning the year-end championships for the second time. He also won his first tournament on home soil by capturing the Swiss Open in Gstaad. His 11 singles titles were the most of any player in two decades, and his record of 74–6 was the best since Ivan Lendl in 1986. He improved his year-end ranking to world no. 1 for the first time.\\n\\n\\n=== 2005: Consolidating dominance ===\\n\\nIn 2005, Federer failed to reach the finals of the first two Grand Slam tournaments, losing the Australian Open semifinal to eventual champion Safin and the French Open semifinal to eventual champion Rafael Nadal. However, Federer quickly reestablished his dominance on grass, winning the Wimbledon Championships over Andy Roddick. At the US Open, Federer defeated Andre Agassi in the latter\\'s last Grand Slam final.\\nFederer also took four ATP Masters Series 1000 wins: Indian Wells, Miami, and Cincinnati on hard court, and Hamburg on clay. Furthermore, Federer won two ATP 500 series events at Rotterdam and Dubai. Federer lost the year-end championships to David Nalbandian, but maintained his position as world no. 1.\\nThe season was statistically one of the most dominant in the Open Era. He won 11 singles titles which tied his 2004 season as the most in over two decades, his 81 match victories were the most since Pete Sampras in 1993, and his record of 81–4 (95.2%) remains the second best winning percentage in the Open Era behind only John McEnroe in 1984.\\n\\n\\n=== 2006: Career best season ===\\n\\nThe 2006 season was statistically the best season of Federer\\'s career as well as one of the greatest seasons of any player in tennis history. In December 2011, Stephen Tignor, chief editorial writer for Tennis.com, ranked Federer\\'s 2006 season as the second greatest season of all-time during the open era; behind only Rod Laver\\'s Calendar Grand Slam year of 1969. Federer won 12 singles titles (the most of any player since John McEnroe in 1984) and had a match record of 92–5 (the most wins since Ivan Lendl in 1982). Federer reached the finals in an astounding 16 of the 17 tournaments he entered during the season.\\nIn 2006, Federer won three Grand Slam singles titles and reached the final of the other, with the only loss coming against Nadal in the French Open. He was the first man to reach all four finals in a calendar year since Rod Laver in 1969. This was Federer and Nadal\\'s first meeting in a Grand Slam final. Federer defeated Nadal in the Wimbledon Championships final. In the Australian Open, Federer defeated Marcos Baghdatis, and at the US Open, Federer defeated Roddick (2003 champion). In addition, Federer made it to six ATP Masters Series 1000 finals, winning four on hard surfaces and losing two on clay to Nadal. Federer, however, consistently pushed Nadal to the limit on clay throughout the season taking him to 4th set tiebreakers in Monte-Carlo and Paris, and a thrilling match in Rome that went to a deciding 5th set tiebreaker.\\nFederer won one ATP 500 series event in Tokyo and captured the year-end championships for the third time in his career, again finishing the year as world No. 1. Federer only lost to two players during 2006, to Nadal four times in finals, and to 19-year-old Andy Murray in the second round of the 2006 Cincinnati Masters, in what would be Federer\\'s only defeat before the final that year. Federer finished the season on a 29 match winning streak, as well as winning 48 of his last 49 matches after the French Open.\\nA personal highlight for Federer came near the end of the season when he finally won his hometown tournament the Swiss Indoors in Basel, Switzerland.\\n\\n\\n=== 2007: Holding off young rivals ===\\n\\nIn 2007, Federer reached all four Grand Slam singles finals, winning three of them again. He won the Australian Open over Fernando González and did so without dropping a set, Wimbledon over Rafael Nadal for the second time, and the US Open over Novak Djokovic. Federer lost the French Open to Nadal. At the Australian Open he became the first man since Bjorn Borg at the 1980 French Open to win a Grand Slam tournament without dropping a set.\\nFederer made five ATP Masters Series 1000 finals in 2007, winning the Hamburg and Cincinnati titles. Federer\\'s victory in Hamburg was particularly impressive as it snapped Rafael Nadal\\'s 81 match winning streak on clay, an open era record. Federer won one 500 series event in Dubai and won the year-end championships. Victory in Dubai brought his career best winning streak to 41 consecutive matches, having not lost since August 2006. He finished as the year-end world no. 1 for the fourth year in a row, demonstrating his dominance, and during these four years he won 11 Grand Slam singles titles.\\n\\n\\n=== 2008: Illness, fifth US Open title and Olympic Gold ===\\n\\nFederer\\'s success in 2008 was severely hampered by a lingering bout of mononucleosis which he suffered from during the first half of the year. At the end of the year he would suffer a back injury that would prove to be reoccurring throughout his career.\\nIn 2008, Federer won one Grand Slam singles title at the US Open over Briton Andy Murray. Federer was defeated by Nadal in two Grand Slam finals, at the French Open, and at Wimbledon, when he was going for six straight wins to break Björn Borg\\'s record. At the Australian Open, Federer lost in the semifinals to eventual winner Djokovic, which ended his record of 10 consecutive finals. Later in the year, it was found Federer had been suffering from mononucleosis at the start of the year, particularly during the Australian Open. He lost twice in Masters Series 1000 finals on clay to Nadal, at Monte Carlo and Hamburg. However, Federer captured three titles in 250-level events at Estoril, Halle and Basel.\\nAt the Olympic Games, Federer and Stan Wawrinka won the gold medal in doubles, after beating the Bryan brothers American team in semifinals and the Swedish duo of Simon Aspelin and Thomas Johansson in the final However, Federer could only reach the quarterfinals in the singles draw, knocked out by then world no. 8 James Blake. He ended the year as world no. 2.\\n\\n\\n=== 2009: Career Grand Slam, sixth Wimbledon, breaking Grand Slam record ===\\n\\nIn 2009, Federer won two Grand Slam singles titles, the French Open over Robin Söderling, and Wimbledon over Andy Roddick. Federer reached two other Grand Slam finals, losing to Nadal at the Australian Open, and to Juan Martín del Potro at the US Open, both in tight five-set matches.\\nThe 2009 season was perhaps the most historically relevant of Federer\\'s career as he completed a career Grand Slam by winning his first French Open title and won a men\\'s record fifteenth Grand Slam singles title by defeating Andy Roddick at Wimbledon in five sets, surpassing Pete Sampras\\'s mark of fourteen. The 2009 Wimbledon final was also historic for being the longest Grand Slam final in terms of games played with Federer prevailing 16–14 in a thrilling fifth set. Upon breaking the Grand Slam record, Federer was hailed by most analysts and many tennis greats as the greatest player in tennis history.\\nFederer won two more events, the first at the Madrid Masters over Nadal on clay. The second was in Cincinnati over Novak Djokovic.\\n\\n\\n=== 2010: Fourth Australian Open ===\\n\\nIn 2010, Federer slowed down in his milestones and achievements. The year started with a win at the Australian Open, where he defeated Andy Murray in the final and extended his Grand Slam singles record to sixteen titles, matching Andre Agassi\\'s record of four Australian Open titles. At the French Open, Federer won his 700th tour match and 150th tour match on clay. However, he failed to reach a Grand Slam semifinal for the first time since the 2004 French Open, losing to Söderling in the quarterfinals and relinquishing his No. 1 ranking, having been just one week away from equaling Pete Sampras\\'s record of 286 weeks as world No. 1. In a huge upset at Wimbledon, Federer lost in the quarterfinals to Tomáš Berdych and fell to No. 3 in the rankings for the first time in 6 years and 8 months.\\nAt the 2010 US Open, Federer reached the semifinals, avenging his French Open loss to Söderling in the quarterfinals, but proceeded to lose a five-set match to third seed Novak Djokovic. Federer made it to four Masters 1000 finals, prevailing at the Cincinnati Masters against Mardy Fish.\\nIn 2010, Federer equaled Agassi for the number of Masters wins at 17 and tied Björn Borg\\'s mark for number of total titles won, moving to just one behind Sampras. Towards the middle of July, Federer hired Pete Sampras\\' old coach Paul Annacone on a trial basis to put his tennis game and career back on the right path.\\nFederer finished the year in strong form winning indoor titles at the Stockholm Open, Swiss Indoors, and the ATP World Tour Finals in London which brought his tally to 66 career titles. Federer won the year-end championships in London by beating rival Rafael Nadal, for his fifth title at the event. He showed much of his old form, beating all contenders except Nadal in straight sets. Since Wimbledon 2010, Federer had a win-loss record of 34–4. Federer finished in the top two for the eighth consecutive season.\\n\\n\\n=== 2011: Sixth World Tour Finals title ===\\n\\nThe 2011 season, although great by most players\\' standards, was a lean year for Federer. He was defeated in straight sets in the semifinals of the 2011 Australian Open by eventual champion Novak Djokovic, marking the first time since July 2003 that he did not hold any of the four Grand Slam titles. In the French Open semifinals, Federer ended Djokovic\\'s undefeated streak of 43 consecutive wins with a stunning four-set victory. However, Federer then lost in the final to Rafael Nadal. At Wimbledon, Federer advanced to his 29th consecutive Grand Slam quarterfinal, but lost to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. It marked the first time in his career that he had lost a Grand Slam match after winning the first two sets.\\nAt the US Open, Federer lost a much-anticipated semifinal match with Novak Djokovic, after squandering two match points in the fifth set, which repeated his previous year\\'s result against Djokovic and added a second loss from two sets up in Grand Slam play to his record. The loss at Flushing Meadows meant that Federer did not win any of the four Grand Slams in 2011, the first time this has happened since 2002. Later that month, in September 2011, in a South African poll, Federer was voted the second most trusted and respected person in the world, next to Nelson Mandela.\\nFederer finished the season on a high note by yet again dominating the indoor season, winning his last three tournaments of the year at the Swiss Indoors, Paris Masters, and ATP World Tour Finals. He ended a 10-month title drought by winning the Swiss Indoors for the fifth time, defeating rising star Kei Nishikori. Federer followed this up with his first Paris Masters title, where he became the first player to reach all nine Masters 1000 finals. At the 2011 ATP World Tour Finals, Federer crushed Rafael Nadal in exactly one hour en route to the semifinals, where he defeated David Ferrer to reach the final at the year-end championships for the seventh time, his 100th tour-level final overall. As a result of this win, Federer also regained the world no. 3 ranking from Andy Murray. In the final, he defeated Jo-Wilfried Tsonga for the third consecutive Sunday and, in doing so, claimed a record sixth ATP World Tour Finals title, finishing the year as world no. 3.\\n\\n\\n=== 2012: Seventh Wimbledon, second Olympic Medal and return to no. 1 ===\\n\\nThe 2012 season was a return to excellence for Federer. He had his most match wins since 2006 and his highest winning percentage and number of titles won since 2007.\\n\\nFederer reached the semifinal of the 2012 Australian Open, setting up a 27th career meeting with Nadal, a match he lost in four tight sets.\\n\\nHe then won the Rotterdam Open for the first time since 2005, defeating Juan Martin del Potro. Federer played in the 2012 Dubai Tennis Championships, where he defeated Andy Murray in the final and won the championship title for the fifth time in his career. Federer then moved on to the Indian Wells Masters, where he defeated Rafael Nadal in the semifinals, and John Isner in the final. Federer won the title for a record fourth time, and, in doing so, equalled Rafael Nadal\\'s record of 19 ATP Masters 1000 titles.\\nFederer went on to compete at the Madrid Masters on the new blue clay surface, where he beat Tomáš Berdych in the final, thus regaining the world no. 2 ranking from Rafael Nadal. In the French Open, Federer made the semifinals before losing to Djokovic.\\nAt Wimbledon, Federer survived an epic five set thriller in the third round against Julien Benneteau on his way to the semifinals. In his semifinal match-up against world No. 1 Novak Djokovic, Federer earned a record eighth Wimbledon final appearance after dispatching Djokovic in four sets. Federer defeated Andy Murray in four sets in the 2012 Wimbledon final, regaining the world number-one ranking in the process. \"It\\'s amazing. It equals me with Pete Sampras, who\\'s my hero. It just feels amazing\", Federer said of winning his seventh Wimbledon championship, tying Sampras\\' Open Era record. By defeating top-ranked Djokovic in the semifinals and winning in the finals, Federer returned to the top spot in the world rankings and, in doing so, broke Sampras\\' record of 286 weeks atop the list.\\nFour weeks after the Wimbledon final, Federer again faced Murray on the Wimbledon centre court, this time for the final of the 2012 Summer Olympics. This came after an epic 4-hour 26-minute semifinal against Juan Martin del Potro of Argentina that Federer won 19–17 in the third and final set. He lost to Murray in straight sets in the final, winning a silver medal for his country.\\nFederer won in Cincinnati, beating Novak Djokovic soundly in the final. In the US Open, five-time champ Federer was defeated by Tomáš Berdych in the quarterfinals. In the Shanghai Rolex Masters, defeating Stan Wawrinka in the third round, Federer confirmed his 300th week at no. 1. Federer made it to the finals of the ATP World Tour Finals, where he lost to Novak Djokovic in two tight sets.\\n\\n\\n=== 2013: Injury struggles ===\\n\\nFederer struggled with serious back injuries sustained in March and again in July and saw his ranking drop from No. 2 to No. 6. The 2013 season was the first since 1999 in which Federer failed to reach a final in the first four months of the year.\\nFederer\\'s first and only title of 2013 came at the Gerry Weber Open (def. Mikhail Youzhny), where he also played doubles with good friend Tommy Haas. With the victory in Halle, he tied John McEnroe for the third-most number of ATP titles won by a male player in the Open Era. Federer, however, was unable to maintain his form into Wimbledon, suffering his worst Grand Slam defeat since 2003 in the second round against Sergiy Stakhovsky. Not only did the loss end Federer\\'s record streak of 36 consecutive quarterfinals at major tournaments, it meant he would drop out of the top 4 for first time since July 2003, exactly 10 years after he won his first Wimbledon title.\\nDuring the summer he experimented with various different racquets and played the German Open with a blacked out 98 inch Wilson racquet instead of his regular Pro Staff 6.1 90 BLX racquet with the smaller 90 square inch hitting area. He returned to his regular racquet for the second half of the season. After Wimbledon, Federer continued to be upset early in tournaments because of a serious back injury through October when he announced that he was parting ways with Paul Annacone, his coach for the last three years. Federer made the final in Basel, succumbing to Juan Martín del Potro.\\nOn 27 December 2013, Federer announced that Stefan Edberg was joining his team as co-coach with Severin Lüthi.\\n\\n\\n=== 2014: Wimbledon runner-up, and Davis Cup glory ===\\n\\nFederer began the season by changing rackets for the first time in his career from his longtime frame of 90 square inches to one measured at 97 square inches. He had long been at a comparative disadvantage in equipment as almost the entire tour including his top rivals Nadal and Djokovic used more powerful frames of between 95 and 100 square inches. Federer played well at the Australian Open, defeating Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Andy Murray to reach his 11th consecutive semifinal in Melbourne, before losing to Rafael Nadal in straight sets.\\n\\nAt the Dubai Tennis Championships, he defeated Novak Djokovic in the semifinals, and then defeated Tomáš Berdych in the final to win his sixth Dubai crown and his first title since Halle in 2013. Federer made the final at the Indian Wells Masters, but lost to Novak Djokovic in a final-set tiebreak. At the Davis Cup quarterfinals, Federer won both of his singles rubbers against Mikhail Kukushkin and Andrey Golubev, the second of which was the first live deciding rubber of his Davis Cup career. Federer then took a wild card into the Monte-Carlo Masters. Federer beat Novak Djokovic on his way to the finals, but lost to compatriot Stan Wawrinka in the final.\\nIn June Federer announced that after the end of his third term he would resign as President of the ATP Players Council, a position he had held since 2008. At the Halle Open, Federer reached both the singles and doubles finals, and won his seventh Halle singles title, beating Alejandro Falla. Federer was seeded fourth at the 2014 Wimbledon Championships. He did not drop serve heading into the quarterfinals where he defeated compatriot Stan Wawrinka in four sets to reach the semifinals. In the semifinals, he defeated Canadian Milos Raonic in three sets to set up a meeting with Novak Djokovic in his 25th Grand Slam final. In the final, he was defeated by Djokovic in an epic five-set match.\\nFederer made the finals of the Canadian Open but was defeated by Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. Federer defeated Spain\\'s David Ferrer in three sets to capture his sixth Cincinnati crown and his 22nd ATP World Tour Masters 1000 title, his first since Cincinnati 2012. It was also his 80th ATP singles title, behind only Jimmy Connors (109) and Ivan Lendl (94) in the Open Era. He then reached the semifinals at the US Open, however lost in straight sets to eventual champion Marin Čilić. Switzerland hosted Italy in the Davis Cup semifinal in September. Federer won both of his singles matches against Simone Bolelli and Fabio Fognini in straight sets and hence led Switzerland to the final for the first time since 1992.\\nFederer then played in Shanghai Masters. In his first match, Federer beat Argentinian Leonardo Mayer in three close sets after saving five match points. He beat Novak Djokovic in the semifinals, ending the Serb\\'s 28-match unbeaten run on Chinese soil. He battled Frenchman Gilles Simon in his second Shanghai final, defeated him in two tiebreak sets and collected the 23rd Masters 1000 title of his career. The victory saw Federer return to world No. 2 for the first time since May 2013. Federer then played the Swiss Indoors in October, where he went on to win a record 6th title and his 82nd ATP men\\'s singles title overall. Federer also reached the finals of the 2014 ATP World Tour Finals to face Djokovic again but withdrew from the final because of another sustained back injury from his semifinal match against Wawrinka in which he triumphed in three sets after saving four match points. Despite his injury, Federer finished the season on a high by defeating Richard Gasquet to clinch the Davis Cup for Switzerland for the first time in its history.\\n\\n\\n=== 2015: 1,000th career win, Wimbledon and US Open runner-ups ===\\n\\nFederer started his season at the Brisbane International. He defeated Milos Raonic in the final, thereby becoming only the third man in the Open Era to have 1000 or more wins, joining Jimmy Connors and Ivan Lendl, as well as the first man in the Open Era to win at least one title in each of 15 consecutive years. After two routine wins at the Australian Open, Federer was upset in the third round in four sets by Andreas Seppi, ending at 11 consecutive years his record-holding streak of advancing to the semifinals or better in the Australian Open. Federer next participated in the Dubai Tennis Championships and successfully defended his title with a straight sets victory over Novak Djokovic in the final, marking his seventh title at the tournament and, after Wimbledon and Halle, was the third time he had won seven or more titles in a tournament. In addition, Federer became the fourth person since 1991, after Goran Ivanišević, Andy Roddick and Ivo Karlović to surpass 9,000 career aces. In March he reached the final of the Indian Wells but lost in three sets to the defending champion Djokovic.\\nFederer won his third title of the season at the inaugural Istanbul Open clay court tournament, ending a title drought on clay since the 2012 Madrid Open. Federer made it to the finals of the Italian Open in May but was unable to win his first title there, losing to Djokovic. At the 2015 French Open, he reached his 44th Grand Slam quarterfinal, where he lost to compatriot and eventual champion Stan Wawrinka. Federer defeated Italy\\'s Andreas Seppi in two sets, to win his record eighth Gerry Weber Open and become only the third man in the open era to win a title eight times.\\nFederer entered Wimbledon as the second seed. He beat Damir Dzumhur, Sam Querrey and Sam Groth in the first three rounds, losing just one set (a tiebreaker) against Groth to reach the second week of the tournament. He easily beat Roberto Bautista-Agut in the fourth round in straight sets to advance to his 13th Wimbledon quarterfinal and 45th overall. He then beat Gilles Simon in straight sets to advance to his 10th Wimbledon semifinal. He then played a flawless match to defeat Andy Murray in straight sets and advance to his 10th Wimbledon final in a repeat against Novak Djokovic. Federer lost the match in four sets.\\nFederer\\'s first competitive tournament since Wimbledon was the Cincinnati Masters. He was seeded second for the tournament but had been surprassed as the world No. 2 by Andy Murray a couple of days back, after his victory at the Rogers Cup. After receiving a bye from the first round, Federer defeated Roberto Bautista-Agut and Kevin Anderson respectively in the second and third round. In the quarterfinals, he defeated Feliciano López in straight sets to advance to a semifinal match against Andy Murray. Against Murray, he won in two close sets to progress to the final. In the final, he defeated Novak Djokovic in straight sets to win the Cinicinnati Masters for the 7th time, also denying Djokovic a Career Golden Masters. By winning, he reclaimed his No. 2 ranking and seeding at the US Open, and this also marked the first time that Federer had beaten the Top 2 players in the world at the same tournament.\\nAt the US Open, Federer was once again the second seed; he advanced to his first final at Flushing Meadows since 2009 without dropping a set and conceding only 43 games, beating Leonardo Mayer, Steve Darcis, Philipp Kohlschreiber, John Isner, Richard Gasquet, and Stan Wawrinka in the process. In the final, he was once again defeated by top seed Djokovic in four sets.\\n\\n\\n== Rivalries ==\\n\\n\\n=== Federer vs. Nadal ===\\n\\nFederer and Nadal have been playing each other since 2004, and their rivalry is a significant part of both men\\'s careers.\\nThey held the top two rankings on the ATP Tour from July 2005 until 17 August 2009, when Nadal fell to world No. 3 (Andy Murray became the new No. 2). They are the only pair of men to have ever finished six consecutive calendar years at the top. Federer was ranked No. 1 for a record 237 consecutive weeks beginning in February 2004. Nadal, who is five years younger, ascended to No. 2 in July 2005 and held this spot for a record 160 consecutive weeks, before surpassing Federer in August 2008.\\nNadal leads their head-to-head 23–10. Of their 33 matches, 15 have been on clay, which is by far Nadal\\'s best surface. Federer has a winning record on grass (2–1) and indoor hard courts (4–1), while Nadal leads the outdoor hard courts (8–2) and clay (13–2). Because tournament seedings are based on rankings, 20 of their matches have been in tournament finals which have included an all-time record eight Grand Slam finals. From 2006 to 2008, they played in every French Open and Wimbledon final. They then met in the 2009 Australian Open final and the 2011 French Open final. Nadal won six of the eight, losing the first two Wimbledon finals. Three of these finals were five set-matches (2007 and 2008 Wimbledon, 2009 Australian Open), with the 2008 Wimbledon final being lauded as the greatest match ever by many long-time tennis analysts. Of their 33 meetings, 11 have reached a deciding set. They have also played in 10 Masters Series finals, including their lone five-hour match at the 2006 Rome Masters which Nadal won in a fifth-set tie-break, having saved two match points.\\n\\n\\n=== Federer vs. Djokovic ===\\n\\nFederer and Djokovic have met 42 times and they are tied 21–21. Federer leads 16–15 on hard-courts and they are tied 4–4 on clay while Djokovic leads 2–1 on grass. The Federer–Djokovic rivalry is the largest rivalry in Grand Slam history with a record 14 matches played against each other with Djokovic leading 8–6. Djokovic is the only player besides Nadal to defeat Federer in consecutive Grand Slam tournaments (2010 US Open and 2011 Australian Open, also 2015 Wimbledon and US Open), and the only player besides Nadal and Murray who has double-figure career wins over Federer. Djokovic is one of two players (the other again being Nadal) currently on tour to have defeated Federer in straight sets at a Grand Slam (2008 Australian Open, 2011 Australian Open, 2012 French Open) and the only player to do so three times. Of their 42 meetings, 15 have reached a deciding set.\\nFederer ended Djokovic\\'s perfect 41–0 start to the 2011 season in the semifinals of the French Open, but Djokovic was able to avenge this loss at the 2011 US Open in five sets after saving two match points against Federer for the second straight year. In the semifinals of Wimbledon 2012, Federer beat defending champion and world No. 1 Djokovic in four sets. The two met again during the finals of the 2014 Wimbledon Championships with Djokovic emerging victorious after 5 sets. Federer also ended Djokovic\\'s 28 straight wins in China at 2014 Shanghai Open. Federer withdrew from the 2014 ATP World Tour final and Djokovic successfully defended his title, the first walkover in a final in the tournament’s 45-year history. Many experts have included the rivalry between Federer and Djokovic as one of the best rivalries in the Open Era.\\n\\n\\n=== Federer vs. Murray ===\\n\\nFederer and Andy Murray have met 25 times with Federer leading 14–11. Federer leads 12–10 on hard courts, and 2–1 on grass. They have never met on clay.\\n\\nThe two have met six times at the Grand Slam level, the first three times in the finals, Federer winning all three of these matches; at the 2008 US Open and the 2010 Australian Open, both of which he won in straight sets, and at the 2012 Wimbledon Championships in which Murray took the opening set, but went on to lose in four sets. However, Murray won their encounter in the semifinals of the 2013 Australian Open, defeating the Swiss for the first time at a Grand slam tournament in five sets. At the 2014 Australian Open, Federer reversed that result, defeating Murray in four sets in the quarterfinals. The most recent meeting between the two in a grand slam was in the semifinals of the 2015 Wimbledon Championships, where a dominant Federer triumphed in straight sets.\\nThey met in the final of the 2012 Summer Olympic Games, in which Murray defeated Federer in straight sets, denying the Swiss maestro a career Golden Slam. Murray also leads 6–3 in ATP 1000 tournaments, 2–0 in finals. They have also met five times at the ATP World Tour Finals, with Murray winning in Shanghai in 2008, and Federer in London in 2009, 2010, 2012, and 2014. Murray is one of only three players to have recorded 10 or more victories over Federer (the other two being Nadal and Novak Djokovic).\\n\\n\\n=== Federer vs. Roddick ===\\n\\nOne of Federer\\'s longstanding rivalries was with American Andy Roddick. Roddick lost his world no. 1 ranking to Federer after Federer won his first Australian Open in 2004. Federer and Roddick met on 24 occasions, including four Grand Slam finals (three at Wimbledon and one at the US Open). Federer\\'s record is 21–3, making Roddick the ATP player with the most tournament losses to Federer. Roddick himself said it was not much of a rivalry, being so one-sided.\\nIn the 2009 Wimbledon final, Roddick lost to Federer in five sets. The match included a fifth set of 30 games (a Grand Slam final record) and was over four hours long. In the final game of the deciding set, Roddick\\'s serve was broken for the first time in the match. With that victory, Federer broke Pete Sampras\\' record of 14 Grand Slam titles, and Roddick apologized to Sampras (who was there) for not being able to hold Federer.\\n\\n\\n=== Federer vs. Hewitt ===\\nLleyton Hewitt and Roger Federer have played each other on 27 occasions. Early in their careers, Hewitt dominated Federer, winning seven of their first nine meetings, including a victory from two sets down in the 2003 Davis Cup semifinal which allowed Australia to defeat Switzerland. However, from 2004 onward, Federer has dominated the rivalry, winning 16 of the last 18 meetings to emerge with an 18–9 overall head-to-head record. This is Hewitt\\'s longest rivalry as these two first played each other as juniors in 1996. They have met in one Grand Slam final, the 2004 US Open final, where Federer won his first US Open title in a lopsided encounter in which Federer scored a bagel either side of a second set tiebreak. Federer has met Hewitt at six of the Grand Slam tournaments in which he lifted the trophy, including all five of his triumphs between 2004 and 2005. Their most recent meeting was at the 2014 Brisbane International, where Hewitt triumphed over Federer in three sets for his first title since 2010, when he also beat Federer to the Halle title.\\n\\n\\n=== Federer vs. del Potro ===\\nJuan Martin del Potro and Roger Federer have played 20 times with Federer leading 15–5. They have met six times in Grand Slams with Federer leading 5–1. Their two most famous Grand Slam meetings both came in 2009. The first was in the French Open semifinals, when Federer survived an epic five-set clash when he was chasing the only French title of his career. The second was in the final of the US Open, where del Potro stunned Federer in five sets, ending his 20-match winning streak at Grand Slams. Another high-profile match was in the semifinals of the 2012 London Olympics, where Federer prevailed 19–17 in a grueling final set to secure the Olympic silver medal. Most recently, they met in the finals of the Swiss Indoors in 2012 and 2013, with del Potro prevailing on both occasions in tight three-set matches.\\n\\n\\n=== Federer vs. Safin ===\\nMarat Safin and Federer played each other 12 times, with Federer leading 10–2. Federer and Safin turned pro within one year of each other, with Safin turning pro in 1997 and Federer in 1998. Federer leads 4–1 on hard courts, 3–0 on grass, and 3–0 on clay courts, while Safin leads 1–0 on carpet. Notable meetings include Federer\\'s defeating Safin at the 2002 Hamburg Masters to win the first Masters 1000 title of his career, as well as Federer emerging victorious in the semifinals of the 2004 Tennis Masters Cup, after winning a tiebreak 20–18 on his eighth match point. Federer also defeated Safin in the finals of the 2004 Australian Open to capture his first Australian Open and second Grand Slam title. However, Safin defeated Federer in the 2005 Australian Open semifinals, having saved one match point in the fourth-set tiebreak, to end a 26-match winning streak by Federer. They met each other five times in Grand Slams, with Federer leading 4–1.\\n\\n\\n=== Federer vs. Nalbandian ===\\nDavid Nalbandian was Federer\\'s biggest rival in his early career. The two played each other 19 times, with Federer leading 11–8. Nalbandian dominated early on, taking all of their first five matches from 2002–03. Federer reversed this trend at the 2003 Masters Cup, where he recorded his first victory, and would go on to win 11 of their last 14 meetings. Federer led 6–5 on hard courts, 1–0 on grass, and 3–1 on clay courts, while Nalbandian led 2–1 on carpet. Notable meetings include Nalbandian\\'s win in a fifth-set tiebreaker to win the 2005 Masters Cup, and Federer\\'s win in the 2006 French Open semifinals. They met each other six times in Grand Slams, with Federer leading 4–2.\\n\\n\\n=== Federer vs. Berdych ===\\nTomas Berdych and Federer have played each other 20 times with Federer leading 14–6. Federer leads 7–5 on hard courts, 2–1 on grass courts, 4–0 on clay courts, and 1–0 on carpet. Berdych won their first professional match, notably upsetting then world no. 1 Federer at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Federer then went on to win their next eight meetings, before Berdych ended the losing streak in 2010, winning 5 of their last 11 meetings. They have met six times in Grand Slams, with Federer leading 4–2, and Berdych is the only player apart from David Nalbandian and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga to defeat Federer multiple times in Grand Slams before the semifinal stage. Their most notable Grand Slam matches took place in the 2009 Australian Open, when Federer prevailed in five sets after dropping the first two sets, the 2010 Wimbledon Championships, and the 2012 US Open, both of which Berdych won in four sets.\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\nFederer has been regarded by many pundits, coaches, past and present players as the greatest tennis player of all time. He dominated the game at his peak and has more grand slam titles (17) than any other men\\'s singles player. He is also the first ever men\\'s singles player to have reached 10 consecutive grand slam finals and a total of 27 grand slam finals. He spent the most amount of time – in the open era – at the top of the ATP Rankings (302 weeks). He also holds the record of the most titles (6) at the year-end tournament, where only the year-end 8 highest ranked players participate. Federer has been ranked among the top 8 players in the world continuously since October 14, 2002 \\nFederer has won the ATPWorldTour.com Fans\\' Favourite Award a record 12 times straight (2003–2014) and the Stefan Edberg Sportsmanship Award (voted for by the players) a record 10 times (2004–2009, 2011–2014), both being awards indicative of respect and popularity. He also won the Arthur Ashe Humanitarian of the Year Award twice in 2006 and 2013. He was named the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year for a record four consecutive years (2005–2008). Federer is at times referred to as the Federer Express, shortened to Fed Express or FedEx, and the Swiss Maestro, or just Maestro.\\n\\n\\n== Playing style ==\\nFederer\\'s versatility has been summarised by Jimmy Connors: \"In an era of specialists, you\\'re either a clay court specialist, a grass court specialist, or a hard court specialist... or you\\'re Roger Federer.\"\\n\\nAn elite athlete, Federer is an all-court, all-round player known for his speed, fluid style of play, and exceptional shot making. Federer mainly plays from the baseline but is also comfortable at the net, being one of the best volleyers in the game today. He has a powerful, accurate smash and very effectively performs rare elements in today\\'s tennis, such as backhand smash and skyhook, half-volley and jump smash (slam dunk). David Foster Wallace compared the brute force of Federer\\'s forehand motion with that of \"a great liquid whip\", while John McEnroe has referred to Federer\\'s forehand as \"the greatest shot in our sport.\" Federer is also known for his efficient movement around the court and excellent footwork, which enables him to run around shots directed to his backhand and instead hit a powerful inside-out or inside-in forehand, one of his best shots.\\nFederer plays with a single-handed backhand, which gives him great variety. He employs the slice, occasionally using it to lure his opponent to the net and deliver a passing shot. Federer can also fire topspin winners and possesses a \\'flick\\' backhand with which he can generate pace with his wrist; this is usually used to pass the opponent at the net. His serve is difficult to read because he always uses a similar ball toss, regardless of what type of serve he is going to hit and where he aims to hit it, and turns his back to his opponents during his motion. He is often able to produce big serves on key points during a match. His first serve is typically around 200 km/h (125 mph); however, he is capable of serving at 220 km/h (137 mph). Federer is also accomplished at serve and volleying, and employed this tactic frequently in his early career.\\nLater in his career, Federer added the drop shot to his arsenal and can perform a well-disguised one off both wings. He sometimes uses a between-the-legs shot, which is colloquially referred to as a \"tweener\" or \"hotdog\". His most notable use of the tweener was in the semifinals of the 2009 US Open against Novak Djokovic, bringing him triple match point. Federer is one of the top players who employs successfully the \"squash shot\", when he gets pushed deep and wide on his forehand wing. Since Stefan Edberg joined his coaching team at the start of the 2014 season, Federer has played a more offensive game, attacking the net more often, and improved his volley shots. In the lead up to the 2015 US Open, Federer successfully added a new unique shot to his arsenal called SABR (Sneak Attack by Roger), in which he charges his opponent, while receiving the serve, and hits a return on the run.\\n\\n\\n== Equipment and apparel ==\\n\\n\\n=== Equipment ===\\nFederer currently plays with the Wilson Prostaff RF97 Autograph, a 97 square inch tennis racquet with 21.5 mm beam, 360g weight, 331 swing weight and 16x19 string pattern (all strung with overgrip). Since the 1998 Wimbledon Junior Championships Federer played with a Pro Staff 6.1 90 BLX tennis racquet, which is characterised by its smaller hitting area of 90 square inches, heavy strung weight of 364 grams, and thin beam of 17.5 millimeters. His grip size was 4 3/8 inches (sometimes referred to as L3). Federer stringed his racquets at 21.5 kg mains/20 kg crosses pre stretched 20%, using Wilson Natural Gut 16 gauge for his main strings and Luxilon Big Banger ALU Power Rough 16L gauge (polyester) for his cross strings. When asked about string tensions, Federer stated \"this depends on how warm the days are and with what kind of balls I play and against who I play. So you can see – it depends on several factors and not just the surface; the feeling I have is most important.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Apparel ===\\nFederer has a contract with Nike footwear and apparel. For the 2006 championships at Wimbledon, Nike designed a jacket emblazoned with a crest of three tennis racquets, symbolising the three Wimbledon Championships he had previously won, and which was updated the next year with four racquets after he won the Championship in 2006. In Wimbledon 2008 and again in 2009, Nike continued this trend by making him a personalized cardigan which also has his own logo, an R and F joined together.\\n\\n\\n== Endorsements ==\\nFederer is one of the highest-earning athletes in the world. He is listed at number two on Forbes World\\'s Highest Paid Athletes list. As of 2013 he remains the top earner in tennis with ten endorsement deals. He makes 40 to 50 million euros a year from prize money and endorsements from Nike and the Swiss companies Nationale Suisse, Credit Suisse, Rolex, Lindt and Jura Elektroapparate. In 2010 his endorsement by Mercedes-Benz China was extended into a global partnership deal. His other sponsors include Gillette, Wilson and Moët & Chandon. Previously, he was an ambassador for NetJets, Emmi AG, and Maurice Lacroix.\\n\\n\\n== Career statistics ==\\n\\n\\n=== Grand Slam tournament performance timeline ===\\nKey\\nWon tournament; or reached Final; Semifinal; Quarter-final; Round 4, 3, 2, 1; lost in Qualification Round; absent from tournament event; or a tournament that was Not Held in a given year.\\nTo avoid confusion and double counting, these charts are updated either at the conclusion of a tournament, or when the player\\'s participation in the tournament has ended.\\nFinals: 27 (17 titles, 10 runners-up)\\n\\n\\n=== Year-End Championship performance timeline ===\\nYear–End Championship finals: 9 (6 titles, 3 runners-up)\\n(i) = Indoor\\n\\n\\n=== Records ===\\n\\n\\n==== All-time tournament records ====\\n\\n\\n==== Open Era records ====\\nThese records were attained in the Open Era of tennis.\\nRecords in bold indicate peerless achievements.\\nRecords in italics are currently active streaks.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\nRoger Federer career statistics\\nTennis records of the Open Era – Men\\'s Singles\\nTennis records of All Time - Men\\'s Singles\\nList of career achievements by Roger Federer\\nATP World Tour records\\nATP World Tour Awards\\nList of Grand Slam men\\'s singles champions\\nList of ATP number 1 ranked singles players\\n2004 Summer Olympics national flag bearers\\n2008 Summer Olympics national flag bearers\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nBowers, Chris (2007).
